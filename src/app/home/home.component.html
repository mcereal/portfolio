          My name is Michael Curtis. I was born in Greensboro, NC where I
          currently reside. I graduated from UNC Greensboro with a BA in
          Sociology. I have been employed in the LTL industry for nine years
          with FedEx Freight. I started as part-time Freight Handler during
          college and after graduation I moved into a full-time roll and was
          eventually promoted into leadership role as an Operations Supervisor.
          From there I moved into the Freight Analysis department and I am
          currently am a Weight/ Dimensions Validations Specialist in the
          Operations Technology Department.

          In my free time I enjoy fishing, running, riding my bikes (motorcycle
          and bicycle), playing video games, cooking, and generally goofing
          around with technology. I have a desktop computer I built a few years
          ago that I like to upgrade piecemeal when I can. I am running Win10,
          Ubuntu, and OSX (Overkill, I know, but it is fun). I am currently
          enrolled in the UNC Chapel Hill Fullstack Flex bootcamp program and am
          loving it so far. I am extremely excited about my new development
          endeavor and can't wait to see what the future holds!
